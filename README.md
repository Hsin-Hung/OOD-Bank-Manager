# Things to note
1.	Initial account only created for manager admin/admin. Other users have to be created.
2.	When opening/closing/depositing into accounts, the user only has to input how much money he wants added. The charge will be a separate transaction.
3.	Internet connection is required to update stocks. An offline method to update stocks is to update the stocks.csv manually.
4.	Bank profits are only added for charging fees, during open and close accounts, checking account transaction and when loan is being paid off.
